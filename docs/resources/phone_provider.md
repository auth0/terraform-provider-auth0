# Resource: auth0_phone_provider

Auth0 allows you to configure your own phone messaging provider to help you manage, monitor, and troubleshoot your SMS and voice communications. You can only configure one phone provider for all SMS and voice communications per tenant.

!> This resource manages to create a max of 1 phone provider for a tenant.
To avoid potential issues, it is recommended not to try creating multiple phone providers on the same tenant.

!> If you are using the `auth0_phone_provider` resource to create a `custom` phone provider, you must ensure an action is created first with `custom-phone-provider` as the supported_triggers

## Example Usage

```terraform
# This is an example on how to set up the phone provider with Twilio.
resource "auth0_phone_provider" "twilio_phone_provider" {
  name     = "twilio"
  disabled = false
  credentials {
    auth_token = "secretAuthToken"
  }

  configuration {
    delivery_methods = ["text", "voice"]
    default_from     = "+1234567890"
    sid              = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    mssid            = "MSXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
  }
}



# This is an example on how to set up the phone provider with a custom action.
# Make sure a corresponding action exists with custom-phone-provider as supported triggers
resource "auth0_action" "send_custom_phone" {
  name    = "Custom Phone Provider"
  runtime = "node18"
  deploy  = true
  code    = <<-EOT
    /**
     * Handler to be executed while sending a phone notification
     * @param {Event} event - Details about the user and the context in which they are logging in.
     * @param {CustomPhoneProviderAPI} api - Methods and utilities to help change the behavior of sending a phone notification.
     */
    exports.onExecuteCustomPhoneProvider = async (event, api) => {
        // Code goes here
        return;
    };
  EOT


  supported_triggers {
    id      = "custom-phone-provider"
    version = "v1"
  }
}

resource "auth0_phone_provider" "custom_phone_provider" {
  depends_on = [auth0_action.send_custom_phone] # Ensure the action is created first with `custom-phone-provider` as the supported_triggers
  name       = "custom"                         # Indicates a custom implementation
  disabled   = false                            # Disable the default phone provider
  configuration {
    delivery_methods = ["text", "voice"]
  }
  credentials {}
}
```
