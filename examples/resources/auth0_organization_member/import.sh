# As this is not a resource identifiable by an ID within the Auth0 Management API,
# organization members can be imported using a random string.
#
# We recommend [Version 4 UUID](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4)
#
# Example:
terraform import auth0_organization_member.my_org_member 11f4a21b-011a-312d-9217-e291caca36c5
