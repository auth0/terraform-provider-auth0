# Resource: auth0_global_client

Use a tenant's global Auth0 Application client.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "auth0_global_client" "global" {
  // Auth0 Universal Login - Custom Login Page
  custom_login_page_on = true
  custom_login_page    = <<PAGE
<html>
    <head><title>My Custom Login Page</title></head>
    <body>
        I should probably have a login form here
    </body>
</html>
PAGE
  callbacks            = ["http://somehostname.com/a/callback"]

## Schema

### Optional

- `addons` (Block List, Max: 1) Addons enabled for this client and their associated configurations. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--addons))
- `allowed_clients` (List of String) List of applications ID's that will be allowed to make delegation request. By default, all applications will be allowed.
- `allowed_logout_urls` (List of String) URLs that Auth0 may redirect to after logout.
- `allowed_origins` (List of String) URLs that represent valid origins for cross-origin resource sharing. By default, all your callback URLs will be allowed.
- `app_type` (String) Type of application the client represents. Possible values are: `native`, `spa`, `regular_web`, `non_interactive`, `sso_integration`. Specific SSO integrations types accepted as well are: `rms`, `box`, `cloudbees`, `concur`, `dropbox`, `mscrm`, `echosign`, `egnyte`, `newrelic`, `office365`, `salesforce`, `sentry`, `sharepoint`, `slack`, `springcm`, `zendesk`, `zoom`.
- `callbacks` (List of String) URLs that Auth0 may call back to after a user authenticates for the client. Make sure to specify the protocol (https://) otherwise the callback may fail in some cases. With the exception of custom URI schemes for native clients, all callbacks should use protocol https://.
- `client_aliases` (List of String) List of audiences/realms for SAML protocol. Used by the wsfed addon.
- `client_id` (String) The ID of the client.
- `client_metadata` (Map of String) Metadata associated with the client, in the form of an object with string values (max 255 chars). Maximum of 10 metadata properties allowed. Field names (max 255 chars) are alphanumeric and may only include the following special characters: `:,-+=_*?"/\()<>@ [Tab] [Space]`.
- `client_secret` (String, Sensitive, Deprecated) Secret for the client. Keep this private. To access this attribute you need to add the `read:client_keys` scope to the Terraform client. Otherwise, the attribute will contain an empty string. Use this attribute on the `auth0_client_credentials` resource instead, to allow managing it directly.
- `client_secret_rotation_trigger` (Map of String, Deprecated) Custom metadata for the rotation. The contents of this map are arbitrary and are hashed by the provider. When the hash changes, a rotation is triggered. For example, the map could contain the user making the change, the date of the change, and a text reason for the change. For more info: [rotate-client-secret](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications/rotate-client-secret). Migrate to the `auth0_client_credentials` resource to manage a client's secret directly instead. Refer to the [client secret rotation guide](Refer to the [client secret rotation guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/auth0/auth0/latest/docs/guides/client_secret_rotation) for instructions on how to rotate client secrets with zero downtime.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# The auth0_global_client can be imported using the global client's ID.
#
# You can find the ID of the global client by going to the
# [API Explorer](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Clients/get_clients)
# and fetching the clients that have `"global": true`.
#
# Example:
terraform import auth0_global_client.global XaiyAXXXYdXXXXnqjj8HXXXXXT5titww
```
