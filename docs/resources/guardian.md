  email         = true
  otp           = true
  recovery_code = true

  webauthn_platform {
    enabled = true
  }

  webauthn_roaming {
    enabled           = true
    user_verification = "required"
  }

  phone {
    enabled       = true
    provider      = "auth0"
    message_types = ["sms", "voice"]

    options {
      enrollment_message   = "{{code}} is your verification code for {{tenant.friendly_name}}. Please enter this code to verify your enrollment."
      verification_message = "{{code}} is your verification code for {{tenant.friendly_name}}."
    }
  }

  push {
    enabled  = true
    provider = "sns"

    amazon_sns {
      aws_access_key_id                 = "test1"
      aws_region                        = "us-west-1"

      sns_apns_platform_application_arn = "test_arn"
      sns_gcm_platform_application_arn  = "test_arn"
    }

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# As this is not a resource identifiable by an ID within the Auth0 Management API,
# guardian can be imported using a random string.
#
# We recommend [Version 4 UUID](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4)
#
# Example:
terraform import auth0_guardian.my_guardian 24940d4b-4bd4-44e7-894e-f92e4de36a40
```
