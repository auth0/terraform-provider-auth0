## Installation

**Terraform 0.13+**

Terraform 0.13 and higher uses the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) to download and install
providers. To install this provider, copy and paste this code into your Terraform configuration.
Then, run `terraform init`.

```tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    auth0 = {
      source  = "auth0/auth0"
      version = "0.29.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "auth0" {}
```

```sh
$ terraform init
```

**Terraform 0.12.x**

For older versions of Terraform, binaries are available at the
[releases](https://github.com/alexkappa/terraform-provider-auth0/releases) page. Download one that corresponds to your
operating system / architecture, and move it to the `~/.terraform.d/plugins/` directory. Finally, run terraform init.

```tf
provider "auth0" {}
```

```sh
$ terraform init
```

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

- Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
- Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
- Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
- Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
- Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
- Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
