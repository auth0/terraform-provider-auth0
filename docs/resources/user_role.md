# Resource: auth0_user_role

With this resource, you can manage assigned roles for a user.

!> To prevent issues, avoid using this resource together with the `auth0_user_roles` resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example:
resource "auth0_role" "admin" {
  name        = "admin"
  description = "Administrator"
}

resource "auth0_user" "user" {
  connection_name = "Username-Password-Authentication"
  username        = "unique_username"
  name            = "Firstname Lastname"
  email           = "test@test.com"
  password        = "passpass$12$12"

  # Until we remove the ability to operate changes on
  # the roles field it is important to have this
  # block in the config, to avoid diffing issues.
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [roles]
  }
}

resource "auth0_user_role" "user_roles" {
  user_id = auth0_user.user.id
  role_id = auth0_role.admin.id
}
```
