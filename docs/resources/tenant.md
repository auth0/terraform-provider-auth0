# Resource: auth0_tenant

With this resource, you can manage Auth0 tenants, including setting logos and support contact information, setting error pages, and configuring default tenant behaviors.

~> Creating tenants through the Management API is not currently supported. Therefore, this resource can only
manage an existing tenant created through the Auth0 dashboard.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "auth0_tenant" "my_tenant" {
  friendly_name           = "Tenant Name"
  picture_url             = "http://example.com/logo.png"
  support_email           = "support@example.com"
  support_url             = "http://example.com/support"
  allowed_logout_urls     = ["http://example.com/logout"]
  session_lifetime        = 8760
  sandbox_version         = "12"
  enabled_locales         = ["en"]
  default_redirection_uri = "https://example.com/login"
  session_cookie {
    mode = "non-persistent"
  }

  flags {
    disable_clickjack_protection_headers   = true
    enable_public_signup_user_exists_error = true
    use_scope_descriptions_for_consent     = true
    no_disclose_enterprise_connections     = false
    disable_management_api_sms_obfuscation = false
    disable_fields_map_fix                 = false
  }
}
```

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# As this is not a resource identifiable by an ID within the Auth0 Management API,
# tenant can be imported using a random string.
#
# We recommend [Version 4 UUID](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4)
#
# Example:
terraform import auth0_tenant.my_tenant 82f4f21b-017a-319d-92e7-2291c1ca36c4
```
