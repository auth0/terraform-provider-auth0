# Resource: auth0_connection_database

With Auth0, you can define sources of users, otherwise known as connections, which may include identity providers (such as Google or LinkedIn), databases, or passwordless authentication methods. This resource allows you to configure and manage connections to be used with your clients and users.

- `name` (String) Name of the connection.

### Optional

- `brute_force_protection` (Boolean) Indicates whether to enable brute force protection, which will limit the number of signups and failed logins from a suspicious IP address.
- `configuration` (Map of String, Sensitive) A case-sensitive map of key value pairs used as configuration variables for the `custom_script`.
- `custom_scripts` (Map of String) A map of scripts used to integrate with a custom database.
- `disable_self_service_change_password` (Boolean) Indicates whether to remove the forgot password link within the New Universal Login.
- `disable_signup` (Boolean) Indicates whether to allow user sign-ups to your application.
- `display_name` (String) Name used in login screen.
- `enable_script_context` (Boolean) Set to `true` to inject context into custom DB scripts (warning: cannot be disabled once enabled).
- `enabled_database_customization` (Boolean) Set to `true` to use a legacy user store.
- `import_mode` (Boolean) Indicates whether you have a legacy user store and want to gradually migrate those users to the Auth0 user store.
- `is_domain_connection` (Boolean) Indicates whether the connection is domain level.
- `metadata` (Map of String) Metadata associated with the connection, in the form of a map of string values (max 255 chars). Maximum of 10 metadata properties allowed.
- `mfa` (Block List, Max: 1) Configuration options for multifactor authentication. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--mfa))
- `non_persistent_attrs` (Set of String) If there are user fields that should not be stored in Auth0 databases due to privacy reasons, you can add them to the DenyList here.
- `password_complexity_options` (Block List, Max: 1) Configuration settings for password complexity. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--password_complexity_options))
- `password_dictionary` (Block List, Max: 1) Configuration settings for the password dictionary check, which does not allow passwords that are part of the password dictionary. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--password_dictionary))
- `password_history` (Block List) Configuration settings for the password history that is maintained for each user to prevent the reuse of passwords. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--password_history))
- `password_no_personal_info` (Block List, Max: 1) Configuration settings for the password personal info check, which does not allow passwords that contain any part of the user's personal data, including user's `name`, `username`, `nickname`, `user_metadata.name`, `user_metadata.first`, `user_metadata.last`, user's `email`, or first part of the user's `email`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--password_no_personal_info))
