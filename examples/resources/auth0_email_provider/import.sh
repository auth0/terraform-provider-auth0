# As this is not a resource identifiable by an ID within the Auth0 Management API,
# email can be imported using a random string.
#
# We recommend [Version 4 UUID](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4)
#
# Example:
terraform import auth0_email_provider.my_email_provider "b4213dc2-2eed-42c3-9516-c6131a9ce0b0"
