# Migration Guide

## Upgrading from v0.46.0 â†’ v0.47.0

There are deprecations in this update. Please ensure you read this guide thoroughly and prepare your potential 
automated workflows before upgrading.

### Deprecations

- [User Roles](#user-roles)

### User Roles

The `roles` field on the `auth0_user` resource will continue to be available for managing user roles. However, to ensure
a smooth transition when we eventually remove the capability to manage roles through this field, we recommend
proactively migrating to the newly introduced `auth0_user_roles` resource. This will help you stay prepared for future
changes.
