# Resource: auth0_connection_database

Auth0 provides database connections to authenticate users with an email/username and password. These credentials are securely stored in the Auth0 user store or in your own database. You can use this resource to create and manage database connections.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# This is an example of an Auth0 connection.

resource "auth0_connection_database" "my_connection" {
  name                 = "Example-Connection"
  is_domain_connection = true
  strategy             = "auth0"
  metadata = {
    key1 = "foo"
    key2 = "bar"
  }

  password_policy                = "excellent"
  brute_force_protection         = true
  enabled_database_customization = true
  import_mode                    = false
  requires_username              = true
  disable_signup                 = false
  custom_scripts = {
    get_user = <<EOF
        function getByEmail(email, callback) {
          return callback(new Error("Whoops!"));
        }
      EOF
  }
  configuration = {
    foo = "bar"
    bar = "baz"
  }
  upstream_params = jsonencode({
    "screen_name" : {
      "alias" : "login_hint"
    }
  })

  password_history {
    enable = true
    size   = 3
  }

  password_no_personal_info {
    enable = true
  }

  password_dictionary {
    enable     = true
    dictionary = ["password", "admin", "1234"]
  }

  password_complexity_options {
    min_length = 12
  }

  validation {
    username {
      min = 10
      max = 40
    }
  }

  mfa {
    active                 = true
    return_enroll_settings = true
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the connection.

### Optional

- `brute_force_protection` (Boolean) Indicates whether to enable brute force protection, which will limit the number of signups and failed logins from a suspicious IP address.
- `configuration` (Map of String, Sensitive) A case-sensitive map of key value pairs used as configuration variables for the `custom_script`.
- `custom_scripts` (Map of String) A map of scripts used to integrate with a custom database.
- `disable_self_service_change_password` (Boolean) Indicates whether to remove the forgot password link within the New Universal Login.
- `disable_signup` (Boolean) Indicates whether to allow user sign-ups to your application.
- `display_name` (String) Name used in login screen.
- `enable_script_context` (Boolean) Set to `true` to inject context into custom DB scripts (warning: cannot be disabled once enabled).
- `enabled_database_customization` (Boolean) Set to `true` to use a legacy user store.
- `import_mode` (Boolean) Indicates whether you have a legacy user store and want to gradually migrate those users to the Auth0 user store.
- `is_domain_connection` (Boolean) Indicates whether the connection is domain level.
- `metadata` (Map of String) Metadata associated with the connection, in the form of a map of string values (max 255 chars). Maximum of 10 metadata properties allowed.
- `mfa` (Block List, Max: 1) Configuration options for multifactor authentication. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--mfa))
- `non_persistent_attrs` (Set of String) If there are user fields that should not be stored in Auth0 databases due to privacy reasons, you can add them to the DenyList here.
- `password_complexity_options` (Block List, Max: 1) Configuration settings for password complexity. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--password_complexity_options))
- `password_dictionary` (Block List, Max: 1) Configuration settings for the password dictionary check, which does not allow passwords that are part of the password dictionary. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--password_dictionary))
- `password_history` (Block List) Configuration settings for the password history that is maintained for each user to prevent the reuse of passwords. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--password_history))
- `password_no_personal_info` (Block List, Max: 1) Configuration settings for the password personal info check, which does not allow passwords that contain any part of the user's personal data, including user's `name`, `username`, `nickname`, `user_metadata.name`, `user_metadata.first`, `user_metadata.last`, user's `email`, or first part of the user's `email`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--password_no_personal_info))
- `password_policy` (String) Indicates level of password strength to enforce during authentication. A strong password policy will make it difficult, if not improbable, for someone to guess a password through either manual or automated means. Options include `none`, `low`, `fair`, `good`, `excellent`.
- `realms` (List of String) Defines the realms for which the connection will be used (e.g., email domains). If not specified, the connection name is added as the realm.
- `requires_username` (Boolean) Indicates whether the user is required to provide a username in addition to an email address.
- `set_user_root_attributes` (String) Determines whether to sync user profile attributes (`name`, `given_name`, `family_name`, `nickname`, `picture`) at each login or only on the first login. Options include: `on_each_login`, `on_first_login`. Default value: `on_each_login`.
- `show_as_button` (Boolean) Display connection as a button. Only available on enterprise connections.
- `upstream_params` (String) You can pass provider-specific parameters to an identity provider during authentication. The values can either be static per connection or dynamic per user.
- `validation` (Block List, Max: 1) Validation of the minimum and maximum values allowed for a user to have as username. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--validation))

### Read-Only

- `enabled_clients` (Set of String) IDs of the clients for which the connection is enabled.

<a id="nestedblock--password_dictionary"></a>
### Nested Schema for `password_dictionary`

By default, the password dictionary contains a list of the [10,000 most common passwords](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10k-most-common.txt); your customized content is used in addition to the default password dictionary. Matching is not case-sensitive.
