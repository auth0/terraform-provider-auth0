# Resource: auth0_action

Actions are secure, tenant-specific, versioned functions written in Node.js that execute at certain points during the Auth0 runtime. Actions are used to customize and extend Auth0's capabilities with custom logic.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "auth0_action" "my_action" {
  name    = format("Test Action %s", timestamp())
  runtime = "node16"
  deploy  = true
  code    = <<-EOT
  /**
   * Handler that will be called during the execution of a PostLogin flow.
   *
   * @param {Event} event - Details about the user and the context in which they are logging in.
   * @param {PostLoginAPI} api - Interface whose methods can be used to change the behavior of the login.
   */
   exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
     console.log(event);
   };
  EOT

  supported_triggers {
    id      = "post-login"
    version = "v3"
  }

  dependencies {
    name    = "lodash"
    version = "latest"
  }

  dependencies {
    name    = "request"
    version = "latest"
  }

  secrets {
    name  = "FOO"
    value = "Foo"
  }

  secrets {
    name  = "BAR"
    value = "Bar"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `code` (String) The source code of the action.
- `name` (String) The name of the action.
- `supported_triggers` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) List of triggers that this action supports. At this time, an action can only target a single trigger at a time. Read [Retrieving the set of triggers available within actions](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/auth0/auth0/latest/docs/guides/action_triggers) to retrieve the latest trigger versions supported. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--supported_triggers))

### Optional

- `dependencies` (Block Set) List of third party npm modules, and their versions, that this action depends on. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--dependencies))
- `deploy` (Boolean) Deploying an action will create a new immutable version of the action. If the action is currently bound to a trigger, then the system will begin executing the newly deployed version of the action immediately.
- `runtime` (String) The Node runtime, e.g. `node16`. Defaults to `node12`.
- `secrets` (Block List) List of secrets that are included in an action or a version of an action. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--secrets))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `version_id` (String) Version ID of the action. This value is available if `deploy` is set to true.

<a id="nestedblock--supported_triggers"></a>
### Nested Schema for `supported_triggers`

Required:

- `id` (String) The trigger ID.
- `version` (String) The trigger version. This regulates which `runtime` versions are supported.


<a id="nestedblock--dependencies"></a>
### Nested Schema for `dependencies`

Required:

- `name` (String) Dependency name, e.g. `lodash`.
- `version` (String) Dependency version, e.g. `latest` or `4.17.21`.


<a id="nestedblock--secrets"></a>
### Nested Schema for `secrets`

Required:

- `name` (String) Secret name.
- `value` (String, Sensitive) Secret value.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# An action can be imported using the action's ID.
#
# Example:
terraform import auth0_action.my_action 12f4f21b-017a-319d-92e7-2291c1ca36c4
```

~> For security reasons importing `secrets` is not allowed. Therefore, it is advised to import
the action without secrets and adding them back after the action has been imported.
