# Resource: auth0_role_permissions

With this resource, you can manage role permissions (1-many).

!> This resource manages all the permissions assigned to a role. In contrast, the `auth0_role_permission` resource only
appends a permission to a role. To avoid potential issues, it is recommended not to use this resource in conjunction
with the `auth0_role_permission` resource when managing permissions for the same role id.
