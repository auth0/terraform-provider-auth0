# Resource: auth0_client_credentials

With this resource, you can configure the method to use when making requests to any endpoint that requires this client to authenticate.

-> Refer to the [client secret rotation guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/auth0/auth0/latest/docs/guides/client_secret_rotation)
for instructions on how to rotate client secrets with zero downtime.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "auth0_client" "my_client" {
  name     = "Application - Acceptance Test"
  app_type = "non_interactive"

  jwt_configuration {
    alg = "RS256"
  }
}

# Configuring client_secret_post as an authentication method.
resource "auth0_client_credentials" "test" {
  client_id = auth0_client.my_client.id

  authentication_method = "client_secret_post"
}

# Configuring client_secret_basic as an authentication method.
resource "auth0_client_credentials" "test" {
  client_id = auth0_client.my_client.id

  authentication_method = "client_secret_basic"
}

# Configuring none as an authentication method.
resource "auth0_client_credentials" "test" {
  client_id = auth0_client.my_client.id

  authentication_method = "none"
}

# Configuring private_key_jwt as an authentication method.
resource "auth0_client_credentials" "test" {
  client_id = auth0_client.my_client.id

## Schema

### Required

- `client_id` (String) The ID of the client for which to configure the authentication method.

### Optional

- `authentication_method` (String) Configure the method to use when making requests to any endpoint that requires this client to authenticate. Options include `none` (public client without a client secret), `client_secret_post` (confidential client using HTTP POST parameters), `client_secret_basic` (confidential client using HTTP Basic), `private_key_jwt` (confidential client using a Private Key JWT), `tls_client_auth` (confidential client using CA-based mTLS authentication), `self_signed_tls_client_auth` (confidential client using mTLS authentication utilizing a self-signed certificate).
- `client_secret` (String, Sensitive) Secret for the client when using `client_secret_post` or `client_secret_basic` authentication method. Keep this private. To access this attribute you need to add either `read:client_keys` or `read:client_credentials` scope to the Terraform client. Otherwise, the attribute will contain an empty string. The attribute will also be an empty string in case `private_key_jwt` is selected as an authentication method.
- `private_key_jwt` (Block List, Max: 1) Defines `private_key_jwt` client authentication method. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--private_key_jwt))
- `self_signed_tls_client_auth` (Block List, Max: 1) Defines `tls_client_auth` client authentication method. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--self_signed_tls_client_auth))
- `signed_request_object` (Block List, Max: 1) Configuration for JWT-secured Authorization Requests(JAR). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--signed_request_object))
- `tls_client_auth` (Block List, Max: 1) Defines `tls_client_auth` client authentication method. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--tls_client_auth))

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# This resource can be imported by specifying the client ID.
#
# Example:
terraform import auth0_client_credentials.my_creds "AaiyAPdpYdesoKnqjj8HJqRn4T5titww"
```

~> Importing this resource when the `authentication_method` is set to `private_key_jwt` will force the resource to be recreated.
This is to be expected, because the pem file can't be checked for differences.
