# Resource: auth0_role

With this resource, you can create and manage collections of permissions that can be assigned to users, which are otherwise known as roles. Permissions (scopes) are created on `auth0_resource_server`, then associated with roles and optionally, users using this resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "auth0_resource_server" "my_resource_server" {
  name        = "My Resource Server (Managed by Terraform)"
  identifier  = "my-resource-server-identifier"
  signing_alg = "RS256"

  token_lifetime                                  = 86400
  skip_consent_for_verifiable_first_party_clients = true
  enforce_policies                                = true

  scopes {
    value       = "read:something"
    description = "read something"
  }
}

resource "auth0_user" "my_user" {
  connection_name = "Username-Password-Authentication"
  user_id         = "auth0|1234567890"
  email           = "test@test.com"
  password        = "passpass$12$12"
  nickname        = "testnick"
  username        = "testnick"
  roles           = [auth0_role.my_role.id]
}

resource "auth0_role" "my_role" {
  name        = "My Role - (Managed by Terraform)"
  description = "Role Description..."

  permissions {
    resource_server_identifier = auth0_resource_server.my_resource_server.identifier
    name                       = "read:something"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name for this role.

### Optional

- `description` (String) Description of the role.
- `permissions` (Block Set, Deprecated) Configuration settings for permissions (scopes) attached to the role. Managing permissions through the `permissions` attribute is deprecated and it will be removed in a future major version. Migrate to the `auth0_role_permission` or `auth0_role_permissions` resource to manage role permissions instead. Check the [MIGRATION GUIDE](https://github.com/auth0/terraform-provider-auth0/blob/main/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#role-permissions) for more info. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--permissions))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--permissions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `permissions`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name of the permission (scope) configured on the resource server. If referencing a scope from an `auth0_resource_server` resource, use the `value` property, for example `auth0_resource_server.my_resource_server.scopes[0].value`.
- `resource_server_identifier` (String) Unique identifier for the resource server.

Read-Only:

- `description` (String) Description of the permission.
- `resource_server_name` (String) Name of resource server that the permission is associated with.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Existing roles can be imported using their ID.
#
# Example:
terraform import auth0_role.my_role XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
