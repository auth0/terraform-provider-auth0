## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# As this is not a resource identifiable by an ID within the Auth0 Management API,
# organization connections can be imported using a random string.
#
# We recommend [Version 4 UUID](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4)
#
# Example:
terraform import auth0_organization_connection.my_org_conn 11f4a21b-011a-312d-9217-e291caca36c4
```
