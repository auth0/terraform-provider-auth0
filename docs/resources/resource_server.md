# Resource: auth0_resource_server

With this resource, you can set up APIs that can be consumed from your authorized applications.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "auth0_resource_server" "my_resource_server" {
  name        = "Example Resource Server (Managed by Terraform)"
  identifier  = "https://api.example.com"
  signing_alg = "RS256"

  allow_offline_access                            = true
  token_lifetime                                  = 8600
  skip_consent_for_verifiable_first_party_clients = true
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `identifier` (String) Unique identifier for the resource server. Used as the audience parameter for authorization calls. Cannot be changed once set.

### Optional

- `allow_offline_access` (Boolean) Indicates whether refresh tokens can be issued for this resource server.
- `enforce_policies` (Boolean) If this setting is enabled, RBAC authorization policies will be enforced for this API. Role and permission assignments will be evaluated during the login transaction.
- `name` (String) Friendly name for the resource server. Cannot include `<` or `>` characters.
- `signing_alg` (String) Algorithm used to sign JWTs. Options include `HS256` and `RS256`.
- `signing_secret` (String) Secret used to sign tokens when using symmetric algorithms (HS256).
- `skip_consent_for_verifiable_first_party_clients` (Boolean) Indicates whether to skip user consent for applications flagged as first party.
- `token_dialect` (String) Dialect of access tokens that should be issued for this resource server. Options include `access_token`, `rfc9068_profile`, `access_token_authz`, and `rfc9068_profile_authz`. `access_token` is a JWT containing standard Auth0 claims. `rfc9068_profile` is a JWT conforming to the IETF JWT Access Token Profile. `access_token_authz` is a JWT containing standard Auth0 claims, including RBAC permissions claims. `rfc9068_profile_authz` is a JWT conforming to the IETF JWT Access Token Profile, including RBAC permissions claims. RBAC permissions claims are available if RBAC (`enforce_policies`) is enabled for this API. For more details, refer to [Access Token Profiles](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/access-tokens/access-token-profiles).
- `token_lifetime` (Number) Number of seconds during which access tokens issued for this resource server from the token endpoint remain valid.
- `token_lifetime_for_web` (Number) Number of seconds during which access tokens issued for this resource server via implicit or hybrid flows remain valid. Cannot be greater than the `token_lifetime` value.
- `verification_location` (String) URL from which to retrieve JWKs for this resource server. Used for verifying the JWT sent to Auth0 for token introspection.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Existing resource servers can be imported using their ID.
#
# Example:
terraform import auth0_resource_server.my_resource_server "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```
