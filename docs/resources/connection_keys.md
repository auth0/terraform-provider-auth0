# Resource: auth0_connection_keys

Client Assertion JWT is a more secure alternative to client secret authentication for OIDC and Okta Workforce connections. It uses a signed JWT instead of a shared secret to authenticate the client. The resource only supports key rotation. Use the auth0_connection_keys data source to read existing keys. Removing the resource from configuration will NOT DELETE the key.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "auth0_client" "my_client" {
  name = "My-Auth0-Client"
}

resource "auth0_connection" "oidc" {
  name     = "OIDC-Connection"
  strategy = "oidc"
  options {
    client_id                       = auth0_client.my_client.id
    scopes                          = ["ext_nested_groups", "openid"]
    issuer                          = "https://example.com"
    authorization_endpoint          = "https://example.com"
    jwks_uri                        = "https://example.com/jwks"
    type                            = "front_channel"
    discovery_url                   = "https://www.paypalobjects.com/.well-known/openid-configuration"
    token_endpoint_auth_method      = "private_key_jwt"
    token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg = "RS256"
  }
}

# Resource used to rotate the keys for above OIDC connection
resource "auth0_connection_keys" "my_keys" {
  connection_id = auth0_connection.oidc.id
}
```
