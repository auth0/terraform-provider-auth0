# Resource: auth0_prompt

With this resource, you can manage your Auth0 prompts, including choosing the login experience version.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "auth0_prompt" "my_prompt" {
  universal_login_experience     = "new"
  identifier_first               = false
  webauthn_platform_first_factor = true
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `identifier_first` (Boolean) Indicates whether the identifier first is used when using the new Universal Login experience.
- `universal_login_experience` (String) Which login experience to use. Options include `classic` and `new`.
- `webauthn_platform_first_factor` (Boolean) Determines if the login screen uses identifier and biometrics first. Setting this property to `true`, requires MFA factors enabled for enrollment; use the `auth0_guardian` resource to set one up.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# As this is not a resource identifiable by an ID within the Auth0 Management API,
# prompts can be imported using a random string.
#
# We recommend [Version 4 UUID](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4)
#
# Example:
terraform import auth0_prompt.my_prompt "22f4f21b-017a-319d-92e7-2291c1ca36c4"
```
