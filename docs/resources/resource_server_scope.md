# Resource: auth0_resource_server_scope

With this resource, you can manage scopes (permissions) associated with a resource server (API).

!> This resource appends a scope to a resource server. In contrast, the `auth0_resource_server_scopes` resource manages
all the scopes assigned to a resource server. To avoid potential issues, it is recommended not to use this resource in
conjunction with the `auth0_resource_server_scopes` resource when managing scopes for the same resource server id.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "auth0_resource_server" "resource_server" {
  name       = "Example Resource Server (Managed by Terraform)"
  identifier = "https://api.example.com"
}

resource "auth0_resource_server_scope" "read_posts" {
  resource_server_identifier = auth0_resource_server.resource_server.identifier
  scope                      = "read:posts"
}

resource "auth0_resource_server_scope" "write_posts" {
  resource_server_identifier = auth0_resource_server.resource_server.identifier
  scope                      = "write:posts"
}
```
