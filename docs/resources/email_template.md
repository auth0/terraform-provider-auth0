This resource allows you to configure email templates to customize the look, feel, and sender identities of emails sent by Auth0. Used in conjunction with configured email providers.

```terraform
resource "auth0_email" "my_email_provider" {
  name                 = "ses"
  enabled              = true
  default_from_address = "accounts@example.com"

  credentials {
    access_key_id     = "AKIAXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    secret_access_key = "7e8c2148xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    region            = "us-east-1"
  }
}

resource "auth0_email_template" "my_email_template" {
  depends_on = [auth0_email.my_email_provider]

  template                = "welcome_email"
  body                    = "<html><body><h1>Welcome!</h1></body></html>"
  from                    = "welcome@example.com"
  result_url              = "https://example.com/welcome"
  subject                 = "Welcome"
  syntax                  = "liquid"
  url_lifetime_in_seconds = 3600
  enabled                 = true
