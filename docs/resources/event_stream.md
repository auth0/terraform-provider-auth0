# Resource: auth0_event_stream

Allows you to manage Auth0 Event Streams.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Creates an event stream of type eventbridge
resource "auth0_event_stream" "my_event_stream_event_bridge" {
  name             = "my-eventbridge"
  destination_type = "eventbridge"
  subscriptions = [
    "user.created",
    "user.updated"
  ]

  eventbridge_configuration {
    aws_account_id = "242849305777"
    aws_region     = "us-east-1"
  }
}

# Creates an event stream of type webhook
resource "auth0_event_stream" "my_event_stream_webhook" {
  name             = "my-webhook"
  destination_type = "webhook"
  subscriptions = [
    "user.created",
    "user.updated"
  ]

  webhook_configuration {
    webhook_endpoint = "https://eof28wtn4v4506o.m.pipedream.net"

    webhook_authorization {
      method = "bearer"
      token  = "123456789"
    }
  }
}

# Creates an event stream with write-only token (recommended for security)
# The token can be passed via variable or ephemeral resource
variable "webhook_token" {
  description = "The webhook token"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}

resource "auth0_event_stream" "my_event_stream_webhook_secure" {
  name             = "my-webhook-secure"
  destination_type = "webhook"
  subscriptions = [
    "user.created",
    "user.updated"
  ]

  webhook_configuration {
    webhook_endpoint = "https://eof28wtn4v4506o.m.pipedream.net"

    webhook_authorization {
      method           = "bearer"
      token_wo         = var.webhook_token
      token_wo_version = 1
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `destination_type` (String) The type of event stream destination (either 'eventbridge' or 'webhook').
- `name` (String) The name of the event stream.
- `subscriptions` (List of String) List of event types this stream is subscribed to.

### Optional

> **NOTE**: [Write-only arguments](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments) are supported in Terraform 1.11 and later.

- `eventbridge_configuration` (Block List, Max: 1) Configuration for the EventBridge destination. This block is only applicable when `destination_type` is set to `eventbridge`. EventBridge configurations **cannot** be updated after creation. Any change to this block will force the resource to be recreated. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--eventbridge_configuration))
- `webhook_configuration` (Block List, Max: 1) Configuration for the Webhook destination. This block is only applicable when `destination_type` is set to `webhook`. Webhook configurations **can** be updated after creation, including the endpoint and authorization fields. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--webhook_configuration))

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The ISO 8601 timestamp when the stream was created.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `status` (String) The current status of the event stream.
- `updated_at` (String) The ISO 8601 timestamp when the stream was last updated.

### Nested Schema for `eventbridge_configuration`

Required:

- `aws_account_id` (String)
- `aws_region` (String)

Read-Only:

- `aws_partner_event_source` (String)


<a id="nestedblock--webhook_configuration"></a>
### Nested Schema for `webhook_configuration`

Required:

> **NOTE**: [Write-only arguments](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments) are supported in Terraform 1.11 and later.

- `webhook_authorization` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) Authorization details for the webhook endpoint. Supports `basic` authentication using `username` and `password`, or `bearer` authentication using a `token`. The appropriate fields must be set based on the chosen method. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--webhook_configuration--webhook_authorization))
- `webhook_endpoint` (String) The HTTPS endpoint that will receive the webhook events. Must be a valid, publicly accessible URL.

<a id="nestedblock--webhook_configuration--webhook_authorization"></a>
### Nested Schema for `webhook_configuration.webhook_authorization`

Required:

- `method` (String) The authorization method used to secure the webhook endpoint. Can be either `basic` or `bearer`.

Optional:

> **NOTE**: [Write-only arguments](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments) are supported in Terraform 1.11 and later.

- `password` (String, Sensitive) The password for `basic` authentication. Required when `method` is set to `basic`.
- `password_wo` (String, Sensitive, [Write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments)) The password for `basic` authentication (write-only). This value is only available during resource creation and update, and is **not** stored in Terraform state. To update the password, increment the `password_wo_version` attribute. Required when `method` is set to `basic` and `password` is not provided.
- `password_wo_version` (Number) Version number for password changes. Increment this value to trigger a password update when using `password_wo`.
- `token` (String, Sensitive) The token used for `bearer` authentication. Required when `method` is set to `bearer`. **Note:** For better security, consider using `token_wo` instead to prevent storing the token in Terraform state.
- `token_wo` (String, [Write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments)) The token used for `bearer` authentication (write-only). This value is only available during resource creation and update, and is **not** stored in Terraform state. To update the token, increment the `token_wo_version` attribute. Required when `method` is set to `bearer` and `token` is not provided.
- `token_wo_version` (Number) Version number for token changes. Increment this value to trigger a token update when using `token_wo`.
- `username` (String) The username for `basic` authentication. Required when `method` is set to `basic`.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# This resource can be imported by specifying the Event Stream ID.
#
# Example:
terraform import auth0_event_stream.my_stream "est_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```
