# Resource: auth0_role_permission

With this resource, you can manage role permissions (1-1).

!> This resource appends a permission to a role. In contrast, the `auth0_role_permissions` resource manages all the
permissions assigned to a role. To avoid potential issues, it is recommended not to use this resource in conjunction
with the `auth0_role_permissions` resource when managing permissions for the same role id.
