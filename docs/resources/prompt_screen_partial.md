# Resource: auth0_prompt_screen_partial

With this resource, you can manage a customized sign up and login experience by adding custom content, form elements and css/javascript. You can read more about this [here](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/universal-login-pages/customize-signup-and-login-prompts).

!> This resource appends a specific prompt screen to the list of prompt screens displayed to the user during the authentication flow.
 In contrast, the `auth0_prompt_screen_partials` resource manages the complete set of prompt screens that are displayed during the
 authentication flow. To avoid potential issues, it is recommended not to use this resource in conjunction with the
 `auth0_prompt_screen_partials` resource when managing prompt screens for the same prompt.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "auth0_prompt_screen_partial" "login" {
  prompt_type = "login"
  screen_name = "login"
  insertion_points {
    form_content_start = "<div>Form Content Start</div>"
    form_content_end   = "<div>Form Content End</div>"
  }
}
```

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

# This resource can be imported using the prompt name and screen_name.
#
# As this is not a resource identifiable by an ID within the Auth0 Management API,
# login can be imported using the prompt name and screen name using the format:
# prompt_name:screen_name
#
# Example:
terraform import auth0_prompt_screen_partial.login "login:login"
```
