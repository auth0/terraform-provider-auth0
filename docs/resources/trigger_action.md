# Resource: auth0_trigger_action

With this resource, you can bind an action to a trigger. Once an action is created and deployed, it can be attached (i.e. bound) to a trigger so that it will be executed as part of a flow.

Ordering of an action within a specific flow is not currently supported when using this resource; the action will get appended to the end of the flow. To precisely manage ordering, it is advised to either do so with the dashboard UI or with the `auth0_trigger_bindings` resource.

!> This resource appends an action to the trigger binding. In contrast, the `auth0_trigger_actions` resource manages all
the action bindings to a trigger. To avoid potential issues, it is recommended not to use this resource in conjunction
with the `auth0_trigger_action` resource when binding actions to the same trigger.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "auth0_action" "login_alert" {
  name   = "Alert after login"
  code   = <<-EOT
    exports.onContinuePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
      console.log("foo");
    };"
	EOT
  deploy = true

  supported_triggers {
    id      = "post-login"
    version = "v3"
  }
}

resource "auth0_trigger_action" "post_login_alert_action" {
  trigger   = "post-login"
  action_id = auth0_action.login_alert.id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# This resource can be imported by specifying the
