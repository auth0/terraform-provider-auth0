# Migration Guide

## Upgrading from v0.49.0 → v0.50.0

There are deprecations in this update. Please ensure you read this guide thoroughly and prepare your potential
automated workflows before upgrading.

### Deprecations

- [Auth0 Global Client](#auth0-global-client)
- [Auth0 Tenant Pages](#auth0-tenant-pages)

#### Auth0 Global Client

The `auth0_global_client` resource and data source were introduced primarily to allow managing the `custom_login_page`
and `custom_login_page_on` attributes in order to manage the custom login page of a tenant. These are now deprecated in
favour of the `auth0_pages` resource.

To ensure a smooth transition when we eventually remove the capability to manage the custom 
login page through the `auth0_global_client`, we recommend proactively migrating to the `auth0_pages` resource. 
This will help you stay prepared for future changes.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Before (v0.49.0)</th>
<th>After (v0.50.0)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```terraform
resource "auth0_global_client" "global" {
  custom_login_page_on = true
  custom_login_page    = "<html>My Custom Login Page</html>"
}
```

</td>
<td>

```terraform
resource "auth0_pages" "my_pages" {
  login {
    enabled = true
    html    = "<html><body>My Custom Login Page</body></html>"
  }
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Auth0 Tenant Pages

The `change_password`, `guardian_mfa_page` and `error_page` attributes on the `auth0_tenant` have been deprecated in
favour of managing them with the `auth0_pages` resource. 

To ensure a smooth transition when we eventually remove the capability to manage these custom Auth0 pages through the
`auth0_tenant` resource, we recommend proactively migrating to the `auth0_pages` resource. This will help you stay
prepared for future changes.

## Upgrading from v0.48.0 → v0.49.0

There are deprecations in this update. Please ensure you read this guide thoroughly and prepare your potential
automated workflows before upgrading.

### Deprecations

- [Trigger Binding Renaming](#trigger-binding-renaming)
- [Organization Member Roles](#organization-member-roles)

#### Trigger Binding Renaming

The `auth0_trigger_binding` resource has been renamed to `auth0_trigger_actions` for clarity and consistency with the `auth0_trigger_action` (1:1) resource. To migrate, simply rename the resource from `auth0_trigger_binding` to `auth0_trigger_actions`.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Before (v0.48.0)</th>
<th>After (v0.49.0)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```terraform
resource auth0_trigger_binding login_flow {
	trigger = "post-login"

	actions {
		id = auth0_action.my_action.id
		display_name = auth0_action.my_action.name
	}
}
```

</td>
<td>

```terraform
resource auth0_trigger_actions login_flow {
	trigger = "post-login"

	actions {
		id = auth0_action.my_action.id
		display_name = auth0_action.my_action.name
	}
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Organization Member Roles

The `roles` field on the `auth0_organization_member` resource will continue to be available for managing an organization
member's roles. However, to ensure a smooth transition when we eventually remove the capability to manage roles through
this field, we recommend proactively migrating to the newly introduced `auth0_organization_member_roles` resource.
This will help you stay prepared for future changes.

## Upgrading from v0.47.0 → v0.48.0

There are deprecations in this update. Please ensure you read this guide thoroughly and prepare your potential
automated workflows before upgrading.

### Deprecations

- [Client Authentication Method](#client-authentication-method)
- [Resource Server Scopes](#resource-server-scopes)

#### Client Authentication Method

The `token_endpoint_auth_method` field on the `auth0_client` resource will continue to be available for managing the
client's authentication method. However, to ensure a smooth transition when we eventually remove the capability to
manage the authentication method through this field, we recommend proactively migrating to the newly introduced
`auth0_client_credentials` resource as this will also give you the possibility of managing the client secret.
This will help you stay prepared for future changes.

  authentication_method = "client_secret_post"

#### Resource Server Scopes

The `scopes` field on the `auth0_resource_server` resource will continue to be available for managing resource server scopes. However, to ensure a smooth transition when we eventually remove the capability to manage scopes through this field, we recommend proactively migrating to the newly introduced `auth0_resource_server_scope` resource.
