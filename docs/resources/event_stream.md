  name             = "my-eventbridge"
  destination_type = "eventbridge"
  subscriptions = [
    "user.created",
    "user.updated"
  ]

  eventbridge_configuration {
    aws_account_id = "242849305777"
    aws_region     = "us-east-1"
  }
}

# Creates an event stream of type webhook
resource "auth0_event_stream" "my_event_stream_webhook" {
  name             = "my-webhook"
  destination_type = "webhook"
  subscriptions = [
    "user.created",
    "user.updated"
  ]

  webhook_configuration {
    webhook_endpoint = "https://eof28wtn4v4506o.m.pipedream.net"

(see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--eventbridge_configuration))
- `webhook_configuration` (Block List, Max: 1) Configuration for the Webhook destination. This block is only applicable when `destination_type` is set to `webhook`. Webhook configurations **can** be updated after creation, including the endpoint and authorization fields. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--webhook_configuration))

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The ISO 8601 timestamp when the stream was created.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `status` (String) The current status of the event stream.
- `updated_at` (String) The ISO 8601 timestamp when the stream was last updated.
