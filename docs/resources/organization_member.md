# Resource: auth0_organization_member

This resource is used to manage the assignment of members and their roles within an organization.

!> This resource appends a member to an organization. In contrast, the `auth0_organization_members` resource manages
all the members assigned to an organization. To avoid potential issues, it is recommended not to use this resource in
conjunction with the `auth0_organization_members` resource when managing members for the same organization id.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "auth0_user" "user" {
  email           = "test-user@auth0.com"
  connection_name = "Username-Password-Authentication"
  email_verified  = true
  password        = "MyPass123$"
}

resource "auth0_organization" "my_org" {
  name         = "org-admin"
  display_name = "Admin"
}

resource "auth0_organization_member" "my_org_member" {
  organization_id = auth0_organization.my_org.id
  user_id         = auth0_user.user.id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `organization_id` (String) The ID of the organization to assign the member to.
- `user_id` (String) ID of the user to add as an organization member.

### Optional

- `roles` (Set of String, Deprecated) The role ID(s) to assign to the organization member. Managing roles through this attribute is deprecated and it will be removed in a future version. Migrate to the `auth0_organization_member_roles` or the `auth0_organization_member_role` resource to manage organization member roles instead. Check the [MIGRATION GUIDE](https://github.com/auth0/terraform-provider-auth0/blob/main/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#organization-member-roles) on how to do that.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# This resource can be imported by specifying the
# organization ID and user ID separated by ":".
#
# Example:
terraform import auth0_organization_member.my_org_member "org_XXXXX:auth0|XXXXX"
```
