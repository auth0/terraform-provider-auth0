# Resource: auth0_connection_keys

Client Assertion JWT is a more secure alternative to client secret authentication for OIDC and Okta Workforce connections. It uses a signed JWT instead of a shared secret to authenticate the client. The resource only supports key rotation. Use the auth0_connection_keys data source to read existing keys. Removing the resource from configuration will NOT DELETE the key.

!> The triggers field is only a placeholder for an arbitrary map used to signal the provider
to perform a key rotation whenever any update is made.
If the resource is removed from the configuration, the keys will not be deleted.


## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "auth0_client" "my_client" {
  name = "My-Auth0-Client"
}

resource "auth0_connection" "oidc" {
  name     = "OIDC-Connection"
  strategy = "oidc"
  options {
    client_id                       = auth0_client.my_client.id
    scopes                          = ["ext_nested_groups", "openid"]
    issuer                          = "https://example.com"
    authorization_endpoint          = "https://example.com"
    jwks_uri                        = "https://example.com/jwks"
    type                            = "front_channel"
    discovery_url                   = "https://www.paypalobjects.com/.well-known/openid-configuration"
    token_endpoint_auth_method      = "private_key_jwt"
    token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg = "RS256"
  }
}

# Resource used to rotate the keys for above OIDC connection
resource "auth0_connection_keys" "my_keys" {
  connection_id = auth0_connection.oidc.id
  triggers = {
    version = "1"
    date    = "2023-10-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `connection_id` (String)
- `triggers` (Map of String) This is an arbitrary map, which when edited shall perform rotation of keys for the corresponding connection. It can host keys like version, timestamp of last rotation etc.The field has no association with API

### Read-Only

- `algorithm` (String) The signing key algorithm.
- `cert` (String) The public certificate of the signing key.
- `current` (Boolean) True if the key is the current key.
- `current_since` (String) The date and time when the key became the current key.
- `fingerprint` (String) The certificate fingerprint.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `key_use` (String) The signing key use, whether for encryption or signing.
- `kid` (String) The key ID of the signing key.
- `next` (Boolean) True if the key is the next key.
- `pkcs` (String) The public certificate of the signing key in PKCS7 format.
- `previous` (Boolean) True if the key is the previous key.
- `subject_dn` (String) The subject distinguished name (DN) of the certificate.
- `thumbprint` (String) The certificate thumbprint.
