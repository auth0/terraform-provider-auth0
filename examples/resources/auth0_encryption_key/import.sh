# As this is not a resource identifiable by an ID within the Auth0 Management API,
# auth0_encryption_key can be imported using a random string.
#
# We recommend [Version 4 UUID](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4)

# Example:
terraform import auth0_encryption_key.my_keys "6f0519ad-ea35-44a3-9b0e-ac9c631612c2"
