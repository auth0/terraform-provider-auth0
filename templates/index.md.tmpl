# {{title .ProviderShortName}} Provider

The Auth0 provider is used to interact with the [Auth0 Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2) in
order to configure an Auth0 Tenant.

It provides resources that allow you to create and manage clients, resource servers, client grants, connections, email
providers and templates, rules and rule variables, users, roles, tenants, custom domains, and many more, as part of a
Terraform deployment.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources and data sources.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf" }}

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider_with_private_jwt.tf" }}

~> Hard-coding credentials into any Terraform configuration is not recommended, and risks secret leakage should this
file ever be committed to a public version control system. See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for a
better alternative.

## Importing resources

the [Auth0 API Explorer](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2) to find your resource ID.
